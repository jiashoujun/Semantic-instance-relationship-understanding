# Semantic-instance-relationship-understanding

This demo provides an effective method to comprehensive extraction of semantic, instance, and relationship information from multisource point clouds for urban environment understanding. 

This method contains two main steps: 
(1) Multiple-source point cloud aggregation uses multiple-source point clouds as the input and outputs high-dimensional geometric and physical features.
(2) Multi-task point cloud interative learning network uses the high-dimensional features as the input and output the scene information including semantic, instance, and relationship. 


More detailed method and result descriptions will be available in our paper:
